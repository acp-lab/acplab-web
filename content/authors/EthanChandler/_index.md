# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Robotics Master's student at WPI with an interest in model-based optimal control for legged robot loco-manipulation problems. My current work includes development of Galileo, a structure-exploiting pseudospectral collocation solver for switched systems. My interests lie at the intersection of classic numerical methods and optimal control theory, particularly for interesting (e.g., underactuated, constrained, nonlinear and/or hybrid) systems, such as legged robots or quadrotors.
