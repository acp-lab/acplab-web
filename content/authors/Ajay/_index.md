I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. With two years of professional experience as a robotics software engineer, developing autonomous navigation capabilities for mobile robots. In my current work with the ACP Lab, I study the integration of perception, and control domains to enable high-performance autonomy while maintaining rigorous safety guarantees. My goal is to advance agile drone flight for real-world across fields.
