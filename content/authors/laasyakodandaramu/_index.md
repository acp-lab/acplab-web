# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My name is Laasya Kodandaramu, and I am a graduate student in Robotics Engineering here at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I cultivated my interest in robotics and control systems. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a few projects, including developing a glue-dispensing application with a UR3 robot and implementing dynamic obstacle avoidance for manipulators in collaborative environments using Non-linear Model Predictive Control. My current project, that combines my passions for control systems and dynamics, is based on developing control algorithms for quadrupedal robots, focusing on variations of Model Predictive Control (MPC) such as Diffusion-Inspired Annealing for Legged MPC (DIAL-MPC). Through this work, I aim to enhance the efficiency of optimal control for legged robotic systems, which are highly dimensional and non-convex. I aspire to continue exploring and solving intricate problems, making meaningful contributions to the field.
