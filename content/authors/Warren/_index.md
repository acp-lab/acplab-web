I am an MS student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, with a focus on, control systems, perception and path planning. My research interests lie in drone technology as well as mobile robots with real-time control and perception algorithms. My aim is to develop autonomous multi-robot systems capable of navigating in the real-world safely at high-speed.
