title: Geometric Impedance Manipulation in Multi-Aerial Robot Systems with Cable-Suspended Loads
summary: Conventional impedance controllers have been used in many human robot applications. Although, clascial impendance formulation have presented suffecul results, the de-cople dynamics related to trasdnlational and angulares displacement is still a field of interes for manuy researches. Thefore, in this work we propose  the use of geometric impedance controller on SE(3), beneficial for human robot operation with complex angular displacements
